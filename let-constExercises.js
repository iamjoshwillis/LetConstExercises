// var offers the ability to redeclare and reassign values, and let creates a block-scoped variable that only exists within a code block. let is also restricted from redeclaring a value, while this is permitted with var.

// while var provides the ability to redeclare and reassign values, const cannot be modified or changed after its declaration

// while neither let or const can be redeclared, only let can be reassigned later on. 

// hoisting is when a newly declared value is moved to the top of the function/region of code they are declared in. This allows it to be valid before it's run later on.
